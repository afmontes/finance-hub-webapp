# Finance Hub Webapp Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
Personal finance management webapp based on Midday's core architecture, customized for personal financial tracking with transaction management as the primary focus. This will serve as AndrÃ©s' personal finance hub while maintaining the codebase's full feature set for potential future expansion.

## Project Goals

## Repository & Deployment Strategy

### **Repository Setup: Independent Repository (Option A)**
This project will be maintained as a completely separate repository from life-LLM for the following reasons:
- Clean separation of concerns (personal life management vs. web application)
- Easier deployment pipeline (hosting services expect repo root)
- Better collaboration capabilities
- Cleaner CI/CD and version control
- No confusion between personal documents and application code

### **Deployment Architecture**
The application uses a multi-service deployment model where code is automatically deployed from GitHub:

#### **Code Flow:**
1. **GitHub Repository** â†’ Contains all source code
2. **Vercel (Frontend)** â†’ Automatically builds and deploys dashboard on git push
3. **Fly.io (Backend)** â†’ Automatically builds Docker container and deploys API
4. **Supabase (Database)** â†’ Managed PostgreSQL with manual migration runs

#### **Key Benefits:**
- **Push to deploy**: `git push` triggers automatic builds and deployments
- **Preview deployments**: Each pull request gets a preview URL
- **Rollback capability**: Easy to revert to previous versions
- **Environment separation**: Different branches can deploy to different environments

## Development Phases

### **Phase 0: Repository Setup & Initial Deployment (Week 1)**

#### **Repository Creation** âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Fork `midday-ai/midday` on GitHub
- [x] Rename repository to `finance-hub-webapp`
- [x] Set up repository as independent project (not in life-LLM)
- [x] Configure repository settings and access

#### **Service Account Setup** âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Set up Supabase project (database, auth, storage)
- [x] Set up Vercel account for frontend hosting
- [x] Set up Fly.io account for backend API
- [x] Set up Plaid developer account (sandbox)
- [x] Collect all API keys and credentials

#### **Deploy Original Midday First (Deploy-First Approach)** âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Configure environment variables in forked repository
  - Environment files use `.env-example` and `.env-template` (not `.env.example`)
  - Copy: `apps/dashboard/.env-example` â†’ `apps/dashboard/.env.local`
  - Copy: `apps/api/.env-template` â†’ `apps/api/.env.local`
  - Fill in Supabase, Plaid, and essential configuration variables
- [x] Set up Supabase database schema with pgvector extension
- [x] Build and deploy API to Fly.io successfully
  - Created custom Dockerfile for monorepo deployment
  - API deployed at: https://finance-hub-api.fly.dev
  - Environment variables configured in production
- [ ] **IN PROGRESS**: Connect GitHub repo to Vercel (dashboard deployment)
- [ ] Deploy original Midday code without modifications
- [ ] Verify full application works in production
- [ ] Test bank connections with Plaid sandbox
- [ ] Validate all core features function properly

**Rationale**: Deploy the original working code first to validate the entire hosting stack before making any customizations. This provides a known-good baseline and ensures the deployment pipeline works correctly.

#### **Deploy-First Approach Benefits:**
- **Immediate validation**: Confirms the tech stack works with your accounts/services
- **Baseline establishment**: Working production environment before customizations
- **Risk mitigation**: Separates deployment issues from development issues
- **Learning opportunity**: Understand the codebase while it's functioning
- **Rollback safety**: Can always revert to original working state
- **Incremental changes**: Each modification can be tested against working baseline

#### **Environment Variable Configuration Details:**
**Essential variables for initial deployment:**
- **Supabase**: URL, anon key, service key, project ID, JWT secret
- **Plaid**: Client ID, secret key, environment (sandbox)
- **Local development**: API URLs, webhook secrets, encryption keys
- **Optional**: Leave all other service variables empty initially (Resend, GoCardless, Teller, etc.)

**Critical Note**: Repository uses `.env-example` and `.env-template` naming (not `.env.example`)
